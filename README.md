This is a project for a fictional e-commerce company.
The website allows to browse through different types of products. All the products data is fetched from the firestore cloud storage and then managed with the help of redux. 
The website provides customers with cart functionality and stripe payments. 
The React Router is responsible for the routing of the project. 
React lazy loading is implemented for the optimal JS bundling.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
